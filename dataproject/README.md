#Fertility and Inflation.

Our project is titled "How does inflation  affect fertility" 

We want to see how inflation affects the fertility, we have also included Gross Domestic Product as this gives an indication on how the economic situation is in our country

The final graph of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb), note you can click on the Titles (names Metrics) to exlcude a graph, hold your cursor over a datapoint to see the exact values and last also zoom in.

#Analysis:
The Gross Domestic Product starts with an increase on 5 pct. after adjusting to a 2 pct. increase each year with the exception of 2016-2017 followed by a sharp decling in 2020 where it only increases with 0,5 pct. following by a boom in 2021-2022 where it increases with 9-11 pct.

Overall this draws a picture of a stable economy recovering from the financial crisis with a boom in 2021-2022.

The Consumer Price Index change is more volatile. It experiences a significant drop around 2011, a rise peaking in 2012, and then falls again sharply by 2023. The most notable point is the extreme dip in 2022, indicating a period of deflation or significant price decreases, followed by a recovery in 2023.

Overall we can see that the covid crisis had a massive effect on the consumer prices during the crisis, while the financial crisis had effects after the crisis.

Fertility seems stable compared to the others, with fluctuations remaining within a narrower range. We observe around the years 2014-2015, after which it stabilizes and shows an upward trend starting around 2020, peaking in 2022.


The stabilazation can be seen as a indicator stable policy changes and economic confidence, which can be interpreted as a society which trusts the government during crises while due to “post-crisis fiscal stimuli packages” or other growth-driving factors.

#Conclusion:
The result we wanted to find was that the relationship between CPI and Fertility would affect the cost of living. Where an increase in  Consumer Price Index, would indicate inflation, which raises the cost of living.  We know that If wages do not keep up with inflation, families may feel financially pressured and may decide to have fewer children. This didn’t happen due to the overall stable nature of the Danish Economy.

Note this a rather simple analysis which drew quite strong conclusion thus also a indicator to why we did not find the desired results.


**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
Sometimes the data can be tricky to load so you might need to install 
''pip install nbformat --upgrade''
